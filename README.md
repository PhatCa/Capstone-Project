# Capstone Project

This site is for people to view and create or delete their recipe online.

## User Story

- As a user I want to be able to check available recipe on the site and share my own recipe on there, If I made a mistake I would be either delete the post or edit the post. I also would like some nutrient information being display using my ingredient

## My Story
- This is my first time using Django as a fullstack application. For previous project I have worked with Django but as a backend framework. Overall, I have no trouble figure out how to wire my code together but one obstacle I came across is my deployment with render.
